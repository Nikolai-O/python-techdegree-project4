Store Inventory Console Application

Techdreegre Unit 4 Project is a store inventory console application. It will clean the provided .csv file, add it to database.db and then allow for product viewing, adding and updating. It will also create a backup .csv file with the latest additions/updates.

Installation and Usage

Before running app.py, make sure you install all packages listed in requirements.txt to your env.

Roadmap

As of 10/12/20, the backup function will simply append to the existing inventory_backup.csv file (if it exists). A future update will not duplicate, but simply update existing entries.
